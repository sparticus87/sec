considerations for being on linux/windows
scheduled tasks
for windows use audicle
ps -elf, htop, top, crontab

Binary Analysis(reverse_engineering)
run file, strings, gidra, 
if x >> 4 = 32 (bit shift) ((32<<4=512)

windows persistence
Run_keys
dll hijacking
exe replacement (right or rename) go to services(description), task scheduler(poorly worded)

if asked to find a file look for hints in question

linux eploit development
gdb steps on target box itself
disass -- finds functions
